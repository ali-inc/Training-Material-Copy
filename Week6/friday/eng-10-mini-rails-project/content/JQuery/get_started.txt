Getting Started with jQuery

Adding jQuery to Your Web Pages:
To start, copy the script tag in the below image into your html file.

Next, in your js file, you need to add a Document Ready Event. All of your jQuery methods must be inside this as follows:

$(document).ready(function(){
   // jQuery methods go here...
});

Basic Syntax:
The jQuery syntax is tailor-made for selecting HTML elements and performing some action on the element(s).

Basic syntax is: $(selector).action() which is comprised of:

- A $ sign to define/access jQuery
- A (selector) to query (or find) HTML elements
- A jQuery action() to be performed on the element(s)
