jQuery Events and Event Methods:

All the different visitor's actions that a web page can respond to are called DOM events. jQuery is tailor-made to respond to these events.

Examples of DOM events are clicking on an element or moving a mouse over an element (see image for more examples).

The most commonly used is a click event. When a visitor clicks on an element with class 'button', for example, you can assign a click event as follows:
$('.button').click();

We now need to apply a method to the event by adding a function:
$('.button').click(function(){
  // action goes here!!
});

Event methods can be used to manipulate HTML and CSS. See the next topic for more.
