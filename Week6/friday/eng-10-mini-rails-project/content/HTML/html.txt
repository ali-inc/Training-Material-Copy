Markup - topic
Tags commonly come in pairs for example <h1></h1>. Although there are some self closing tags and are unpaired. An example of a self closing tag would be the image tag denoted as <img>. A very important component of a webpage markup is the document type declaration. This tells the browser which version/standard of the html language to interpret and render. The latest standard of html is html5 which is declared as <!DOCTYPE html>. If we do not specify this, different pages may interpret the html in a different way.
