### Level 1 (Mandatory) 

To create a complex story using various control flow methods. It must:

* use every Data Type (integers, arrays, objects etc) 
* use if, if/else, if/else, if/else and Switch statements
* use every comparison operator (<, >, <=, >= etc)
* use at least one multiple condition per statement **if( true && true )** OR  **if( true || false )**
* Use as many in-built functions as possible: 
	* prompts and alerts are mandatory
	* other methods like length, reverse, indexOf, substr, and any others you can find
* The story should be fun and entertaining!!

### Level 2 (optional)
Watch [Javascript Fundamentals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEROU2XtPR8&t=1419s) (we've covered most of the things in class but the video also covers functions which will be a useful runup to next week)

### Level 3 (optional)
Without using Bootstrap, create a single front page of your own design, practising everything we've covered so far. This is for your own benefit. 

The [w3schools How-To](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/default.asp) page is outstanding for seeing how some features can be built from scratch (modals, accordions, off-canvas menus, tool-tips, mega-menus etc). Go crazy and have fun!
