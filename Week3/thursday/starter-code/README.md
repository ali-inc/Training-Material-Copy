# JQuery Lab

## Timings

30 - 45 Minutes

## Summary

You've been provided with a list of interesting facts. Using jQuery, add some new facts to the list and apply some classes to the list elements to make them look nicer.

## Tasks

* Add a new fact of your own to the beginning of the list.
* Add each of the facts in the "newFacts" array in index.js to the end of the list.
* Give each evenly numbered fact in the list a class of even and each oddly numbered one a class of odd and see what changes.
* Add an event listener so that when you hover your cursor over a fact, it has a class of selected and then removes it when you move the cursor off.
